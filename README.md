# Courses
This repo contains some examples of my code that were written during courses. Some of the examples are rather simple, and are by no means meant to be a comprehensive display of my coding skills. There is a folder for the language/skill focus of each course (JavaScript, SQL, and the DOM API). Please note that there is not a folder for my HTML/CSS coursework. A better example of my HTML/CSS knowledge can be found in the [ercreager.github.io](https://github.com/ercreager/ercreager.github.io) repository, which contains all the code for my personal website.
